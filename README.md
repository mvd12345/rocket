# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains the RobustaPlus bytecode analysis tool and a minimal, anonymized artifact package for double-blind review. The tool analyzes compiled Java bytecode (`.class` or `.jar`), not source code.

See:
- `QUICKSTART.md` for a short build-and-run path.
- `REPRODUCE.md` for full reproduction steps.
- `OPEN_SCIENCE_APPENDIX.md` for artifact scope and hosting guidance.
